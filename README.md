encrypton
=========

Basic txt file encryption using python

how it works
============

Running the included EncryptionProgram.py will start a program that will use the included charset.dat and spaceset.dat to decide what characters are allowed, and which characters are used for spaces.

The program asks for a file in the same directory and it must include an extension for it to find the file.
